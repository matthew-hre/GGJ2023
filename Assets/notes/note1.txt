June 4th, 1972

Son, I know I wasn't the best
father at times.... I drove your
mother awry, and after she left,
I couldn't take it. Over the
years I was a terrible father
to you and Andre. 

I am ashamed of the man I
became, and I know there will
be nothing I can do to regain
your trust. Both of you have
moved on with your life. Andre
has stopped seeing me. he
wont return my calls. 

I write this to you in hopes
that you can visit. address 194
Scurfield SE. It was your
grandmothers house. If you
keep going down the dirt road,
you will see a house near the
ridge. you will find me there.
i must make ammends, and i
would like to spend my last
moments with my blood. it
is good to be surrounded by
your roots. i know i cant take
back what i did, but i can at
least be a good father to
you now.

please, i dont have long.
the doctor said it is a matter of
weeks before i may pass. i hope
this letter reaches you in time.

love,
your father.
